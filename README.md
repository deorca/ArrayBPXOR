A secret-sharing command-line tool for files

The project is comprises two implementations: one in C++, one in Python. More may be added in the future.

The tool was built upon work the author did for an MSc degree project at the University of Liverpool during 2013.

The basic premise behind the utility of the tool is that a file may be split into several encrypted shares, 
any two of which are required to recreate the original.
